        <notes>A Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux application running on JDK 9+ may be vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE)
            via data binding. The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If the
            application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit.
            However, the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.

            for Java deserialization of untrusted data. Depending on how the library is implemented within a product, this
            issue may or not occur, and authentication may be required. NOTE: the vendor's position is that untrusted data is
            not an intended use case. The product's behavior will not be changed because some users rely on deserialization of
            trusted data.
